  The 3D model is colored by <a href='https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-022-01574-4'>DAQ(AA) score</a> scaled from red (-1.0) to blue (1.0) with a 19 residues sliding window.<br>
  The 3D model contains four models (with rosetta)/ two models (without rosetta).<br>
  In MODEL1, Ca-only structure, all modeled positions are colored by DAQ(AA) score. <br> 
  In MODEL2, Ca-only structure, amino acids with DAQ(CA) score below -0.5 are excluded, and amino acids with DAQ(AA) score below -0.5 are replaced with UNK.  <br>
  (with rosetta)In MODEL3, full-atomic structure, all modeled positions are colored by DAQ(AA) score.  <br>
  (with rosetta)In MODEL4, full-atomic structure, amino acids with DAQ(CA) score below -0.5 are excluded, and amino acids with DAQ(AA) score below -0.5 are replaced with UNK. <br>
